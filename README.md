Super Awesome Black Jack

Written for Oplus coding Challenge

Written in Python 3.9.1

To Run:
Be sure to have python 3.9.1 or higher installed on your machine, I recommend running it from the command line: Python3 BlackJack.py

It should be fine to Run it with Python Launcher as well, but Python Launcher seems to not get along very well with Mac OS Catalina.
